This project involves an in-depth analysis of data related to suicide bombing attacks in Pakistan using Python and Google Colab.
By applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, the project explores patterns, frequencies, locations, and the impact of these attacks over time.
The goal is to uncover trends that can inform security policies, preventive measures, and contribute to peacekeeping and counter-terrorism strategies. 
This analysis also examines the socio-political and demographic factors associated with these incidents, providing valuable insights for stakeholders.
